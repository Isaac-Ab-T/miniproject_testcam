# miniproject_testcam
Testcam is an online Exam administration software written entirely in Python.

The aim of the project is to meet these requirements and provide a simple platform for teachers 
to create question papers, evaluate them and run these tests. On the other hand, students 
are able to attend the exam through the software and check their grades in previous tests.
The teacher and student functions are integrated into a simple GUI with the data being stored
on an online SQL server, making data readily accessible to users anywhere.
